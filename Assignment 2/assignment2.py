For question 2, the code is changed in line 10 for the different signs. 
For question 1, the indexing portion of the code is removed, and all the stopword 
values are changed to false in order to compare. 

Most of the frequent words with stopword filtering occur at 
the beginning of the horoscope, with the highest value being 1 in both documents. 
This produced a value of 0.0, meaning that the documents are not similar at all. 

Without stopword filtering, most of the frequent words also occur at the start 
of the horoscopes, however the value doesnâ€™t go over 3. Without stopwords, it produced 
a value of 0.4393747751637468, meaning it is slightly similar, but not identical. 

All the horoscopes are different for each of the signs. Pisces is concerned with their
job, and possibly changing directions in life, they may be scared of failure. 
Virgo is more concerned with those close to them, and possibly annoying someone, 
while Scorpio is concerned with money, and the wealthy side of life, which is somewhat similar 
to Pisces being worried about their career.
