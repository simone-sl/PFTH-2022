## Assignment Specification:

# Assignment 1: Pattern Generation, Authorization Test, and Sequence Generation
In this assignment you have to use your knowledge of strings, tabular data, and machine learning to train a horoscope classifier in Python 3.

# 1. Binary classification
Train a binary (two-label) Naive Bayes classifier that predicts two classes (e.g., virgo and pisces) of the sign variable from the horosope content of horoscope. Knowing that the baseline (Zero Rate) accuracy is approximately 50%, discuss the performance (accuracy and confusion matrix) of your classifier.

# 2. Effects of preprocessing
Preprocessing your natural language data before training a classifier can improve performance considerably, Look at the documentation for the CountVectorizer() function and use some of the parameters to preprocess your horoscope data. Then train two binary classifier and discuss one with and one without preprocessing and compare the performance.
