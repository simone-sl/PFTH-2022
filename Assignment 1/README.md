## Assignment Specification:

# Assignment 1: Pattern Generation, Authorization Test, and Sequence Generation
Assignment 1 tests your understanding of basic Python syntax, components of flow control and procedural programming with functions. You only have to solve two out of three problems (Pattern generation, Authorization test, and Sequence generation), but if you feel up to it, go for all three. Your answers should consist of the code for solving a problem and a step-wise explanation of how and why you have chosen to implement the solution as you have. Use you computational thiking template: Problem, Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Validation, Design Solution.

# 1. Pattern generation
Task: Write a script that uses flow control statements to generate the following pattern. Ensure that your script can continue the pattern

# 2. Authorization test
Task: Write a script that uses at least one function to accept user input of name and password, prints a polite welcome to the user, and tests if the password is correct (you decide the correct password).

# 3. Sequence generation
Task: Write a script that uses at least one function that when it takes 15 as an argument, it generates this sequence '0010102030508013021034055089014402330377'. The solution must be scalable to the set of all positive integers.
